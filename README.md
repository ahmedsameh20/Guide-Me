# Guide-Me
You are traveling abroad, and you want to tour the country and enjoy
every place in it. Based on your previous travel experience you know
that there are lots of ways of transportation between cities and their
prices hugely vary. You have a limited amount of money, and you
want to explore the country but stay on the budget.
Implement an application (C++ program) that reads from a file the
country map (a graph that represents the cities and all the available
transportation with their prices). The user should enter the source
and destination of his trip and the amount of money he can pay, and
the app should show him all the available transportation options (or a
series of different transportation) that he can afford.
